# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits)

# It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple. The len() function returns the length of the tuple.
this_tuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
